__Trivia.__ Before 2001, I was never one to write my thoughts down. But the idea of publishing on the web gave wings to my inert narcissistic tendencies. Soon I mopped-up everything there was to learn about the mechanics of publishing. In ten subsequent years, I produced an unremarkable collection of bad writing, a great majority of which were short, observational bursts, none of enduring value. They have not made it to this archive. May be in the next ten, who knows I might realise the same about those that _are_ published here.
