This domain exists mainly to be a pointer to an MX record. The author put the idling A record to use, mostly as an afterthought, which turned-on the lights here. Built with [Chisel][c1], this site respects web standards, produces valid [HTML][v1], [CSS][v2], [RSS][v3] markups, and is phone-friendly. Handy keyboard shortcuts are available as below. On MacOS: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Opt</kbd> + <kbd><i>Key</i></kbd>. On Linux and Windows: <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd><i>Key</i></kbd>:

| Key          | Link        | Works on          |
| ------------ | ----------- | ----------------- |
| <kbd>/</kbd> | Home        | All pages         |
| <kbd>a</kbd> | About       | Homepage, Archive |
| <kbd>r</kbd> | Archive     | - do -            |
| <kbd>1</kbd> | Latest note | - do -            |
| <kbd>0</kbd> | First note  | - do -            |
| <kbd>j</kbd> | Prev        | All note pages    |
| <kbd>k</kbd> | Next        | - do -            |

_Code._ To ensure it works as intended, all code published on this site is pre-tested without exceptions. Some of the older code snippets may contain [legacy python code][p2]. These should still work with last of python version 2. (Most personal projects are in [repositories][gh] and in [gists][gs].)
