	<b>Trivia.</b> In 2001, I became interested in switching from a static homepage to writing, which became easier with the availability of interesting and low-cost tools. Soon I mopped-up everything there was to learn about the mechanics of publishing. In ten subsequent years, I produced an unremarkable collection of bad writing, a great majority of which were short, observational bursts, none of enduring value. They have not made it to this archive. May be in the next ten, who knows I might realise the same about those that <i>are</i> published here.
